/**********************************************************************
 *  Degree of Success
 **********************************************************************
I would say my degree of success is a 99%. I was successfull in all the test cases.
The program adds the two integers and if overflow is detected it prints an error message.
The program doesn't loop but it successfully outputs the correct data. 

/**********************************************************************
 *  Approach
 **********************************************************************
 I began with the starter code we were given. I went back and rewatched the lecure
 where the professor explained the assignment and how to do the conversions.
 Then I began writing the AddInput function. 
 Having access to those recordings and having the information very cleary
 explained was the key to my success.
