/**********************************************************************
 *  Degree of Success
 **********************************************************************
I would say my degree of success is a 100%. I was successfull in all the test cases.
The program still doesn't loop but outputs the correct data. I successfully split
up all of the code into the proper *.asm files, linked them, and ran the executable
with the test data from assignment five. 


/**********************************************************************
 *  Approach
 **********************************************************************
 I began with the starter code we were given. I copied over most functions from
 the help directory. Wrote the rest of linker. Added the makefile for simplicity. 
 Tested the data from assignment five once I split up the code and wrote the linker.
 The professor also did a good job going over the assignment in class. I rewatched the
 recording multiple times to figure out exactly what to do.

The program doesn't loop.
